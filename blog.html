  <h1> Benefits of Yoga</h1>
  <br><br>
<h4>&emsp;1. Yoga improves strength, balance and flexibility.</h4>
<p>&emsp;Slow movements and deep breathing increase blood flow and warm up muscles, while holding a pose can build strength.<br>
<br>
 </p>
<h4>&emsp;2. Yoga helps with back pain relief.</h4>
<p>&emsp;Yoga is as good as basic stretching for easing pain and improving mobility in people with lower back pain. The American College of Physicians recommends yoga as a first-line treatment for chronic low back pain.<br>

<h4>&emsp;3. Yoga can ease arthritis symptoms.</h4>
<p>&emsp;Gentle yoga has been shown to ease some of the discomfort of tender, swollen joints for people with arthritis, according to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24517304">a Johns Hopkins review of 11 recent studies</a>.
 <br><br></p>
<h4>&emsp;4. Yoga benefits heart health.</h4>
<p>&emsp;Regular yoga practice may reduce levels of stress and body-wide inflammation, contributing to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/wellness-and-prevention/the-yoga-heart-connection">healthier hearts.</a>&nbsp;Several of the factors contributing to heart disease, including high blood pressure and excess weight, can also be addressed through yoga.

  <br>
<h4>&emsp;5. Yoga relaxes you, to help you sleep better.</h4>
<p>&emsp;Research shows that a consistent bedtime yoga routine can help you get in the right mindset and prepare your body to fall asleep and stay asleep.</p><br>  
<h4>&emsp;6. Yoga can mean more energy and brighter moods.</h4>
<p>&emsp;You may feel increased mental and physical energy, a boost in alertness and enthusiasm, and fewer negative feelings after getting into a routine of practicing yoga.</p><br>
<h4>&emsp;7. Yoga helps you manage stress.&nbsp;</h4>
 <p>According to the National Institutes of Health, scientific evidence shows that yoga supports stress management, mental health, mindfulness, healthy eating, weight loss and quality sleep.</p><br>
<h4>&emsp;8. Yoga connects you with a supportive community.&nbsp;</h4>
<p>&emsp;Participating in yoga classes can ease loneliness and provide an environment for group healing and support. Even during one-on-one sessions loneliness is reduced as one is acknowledged as a unique individual, being listened to and participating in the creation of a personalized yoga plan.</p><br>
<h4>&emsp;9. Yoga promotes better self-care.&nbsp;</h4>
<p>&emsp;Numerous studies show yoga’s benefits in arthritis, osteopenia, balance issues, oncology, women’s health, chronic pain and other specialties.</p><br>
